# Blueprint

---
#### ***Balatro Seed Tools***

* Based on [The Soul](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/The-Soul/blob/main/immolate.js) from [MathIsFun0](https://github.com/MathIsFun0)
* Built with Vite And Mantine for a clean and visually cohesive experience. 

## Roadmap
* Add the ability to select unlocked jokers to the project.
* Add the ability to tap cards to mark them as purchased and generate a shopping list so you can save it locally and map out seeds more easily
* polish the card displays.
* Suggestions ?
